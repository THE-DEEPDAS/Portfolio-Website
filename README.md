# Deep Das - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my **personal portfolio website**, which showcases my academic, technical, and co-curricular achievements. It is built using **React.js** with **React Router** for navigation between multiple pages, and **CSS** for styling. The website is fully responsive and provides an engaging user experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **React.js**: Utilized for building dynamic and reusable UI components.
- **React Router**: Implemented for seamless navigation across various pages such as "Academic," "Technical," "Co-curricular," "About," "Contact," and "Testimonials."
- **CSS**: Custom CSS is used for styling, ensuring a clean and professional design across all devices.
- **Modular Components**: Every section of the website, including the navigation bar, hero section, and project cards, is built as reusable React components.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using flexible CSS grid and flexbox techniques.

## üåê Pages and Components
